## grid-list
an almost never up to date list of 'Lightweight, Responsive and modern CSS Frameworks'

## What is this
this is a tabled list of a bunch of css frameworks. i decided to make this list after seeing so damn many frameworks list themseleves as 'a modern, responsive, and lightweight CSS framework', which i find hilarious.
___
listed in this table is just the link to the site, and the size of the singular {framework}.min.css file, or whichever/however many dependants are needed to make the framework....work (_lookin at you hack.css and basscss_). this **Does Not** include any additional .js, sass settings, plugins or anything else, even if they are included in the `npm install` as a single package.

these are organized by size (smallest -> largest)
